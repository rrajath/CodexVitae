Codex Vitae is also called the Book of Life. The objective is to write all the things you've learned in your life as a book.

As you learn things, you'll have opinions on those things and other things too, which means your opinions can change.

This repo will be a living document of capturing my thoughts, beliefs and learnings from many years.
