Top-level index containing one-liner beliefs.


# On Life

-   Life is inherently meaningless. The universe does not care about us and is not obligated to make sense to us
-   Life is basically an extremely small window of conscious <span class="underline">being</span> with billions of years of non-existence before and after our alive-time.
-   In the end, nothing matters
-   We're not the last stop in the evolutionary chain (unless we destroy ourselves), we're just another step, another cog, as genes continue to propagate


# On perspectives

-   Time boundaries are mental shortcuts, lot of times we don't have to conform to them
-   Analysis Paralysis and Perfectionism are one of the worst ways we stop ourselves from achieving what we set out to achieve
-   Time passes by whether you like it or not, the best moment is now!


# On Religion/Spirituality/Theism

-   God is a personified and glorified version of a human, not the other way around
-   Concept of God is irrelevant, seems to play no role in any of the events/happenings if you think hard enough
-   Personal existential itch is scratched by the belief in higher power that leads to some level of psychological/spiritual comfort
-   Every religion started as a sense of deep connection and belonging through rituals that have slowly gotten diluted and lost in translation
