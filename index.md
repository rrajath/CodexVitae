Top-level index containing one-liner beliefs.


# On Life

-   Life is inherently meaningless. The universe does not care about us and is not obligated to make sense to us.
-   Life is basically an extremely small window of conscious <span class="underline">being</span> with billions of years of non-existence before and after our alive-time.
-   In the end, nothing matters.
-   We're not the last stop in the evolutionary chain (unless we destroy ourselves), we're just another step, another cog, as genes continue to propagate.
-   Doing nothing is the best option in most cases.
-   Failures are events, not identities.
-   One must try their best to see reality as it is than as they want it to be.
-   There is no good or bad, only "doing our best"
-   You believe what you repeatedly tell yourself. You can change that narrative anytime.
-   Embrace all emotions/feelings equally. Nothing is more important than the other.
-   Anxiety about the future, frustration from the past doesn't matter. What matters is what you're experiencing right here, right now. That's what is real.
-   You can't block only one or few emotions. You end up blocking all of them.
-   Experience life fully, both good and bad parts. They're all part of the package.
-   Accept what you're feeling even if it's uncomfortable or you don't like it. Don't fight it.
-   Life is a single player open world adventure, where the skill tree is not clearly defined, acquired skills are not permanent and goals are fuzzy and subjective.
-   Embrace every emotion (positive or negative) fully. Don't fight it. It's all part of the experience of being alive.


# Day-to-day stuff

-   Any plan that depends on an external event or individual has to have an asterisk next to it.
-   Effort and impact are non-linear.
-   Epiphanies about a thing almost always happen when you step away from that thing.
-   Pretty much all upgrades come with a maintenance cost.
-   If you really want to learn about something, don't watch the news.
-   Your age is the average of how you feel physically and how you feel mentally.
-   If something *can* be automated, it *must* be automated.
-   Anxiety and procrastination about a task must not be suppressed or ignored as there are signals that tell you why you don't want to do it. Digging deeper reveals the real problem.


# On Perspectives

-   Time boundaries are mental shortcuts, lot of times we don't have to conform to them.
-   Analysis Paralysis and Perfectionism are one of the worst ways we stop ourselves from achieving what we set out to achieve.
-   Time passes by whether you like it or not, the best moment is now!
-   Don't shoot down bad ideas if you don't have better alternatives
-   Reality is often more complex than it seems. The first opinion we form on a subject is often wrong since we never have the full picture.
-   Second order thinking is highly underrated and we often stop at the first explanation we have about something.
-   Quiet moments, the ones where you are disconnected from devices and activities are the most valuable ones that most people overlook.
-   We often end up solving the wrong problems. Always ask yourself frequently - what is the real problem?


# On Religion/Spirituality/Theism

-   God is a personified and glorified version of a human, not the other way around.
-   Concept of God is irrelevant, seems to play no role in any of the events/happenings if you think hard enough.
-   Personal existential itch is scratched by the belief in higher power that leads to some level of psychological/spiritual comfort.
-   Every religion started as a sense of deep connection and belonging through rituals that have slowly gotten diluted and lost in translation.
-   Every ritual has a deep meaning to it and most of them are lost in translation now. What may seem pointless now once had a specific spiritual purpose, if only one pauses to think and understand it.


# On Learning

-   Learning is 50% done when you consume information, 75% done when you apply what you learned, and 100% done when you teach it to someone.
-   Systems thinking is underrated and should be compulsory for everyone to learn.
-   Being unaware of cognitive biases (at least some of the basic ones) is like being okay with being blindfolded.
-   The more one learns about domains other than their profession, the more they appreciate the (complex) world around them.


# On Health

-   Sleep is one of the most important things that most people neglect and take for granted.
-   Endurance sport is more to do with the mind than the body.
-   Taking care of one's health is one's own responsibility and is often ignored until one falls sick.
-   Understanding how a human body works helps with handling surprises


# On Reading

-   Reading books is one of the best investments one can make in themselves. It improves your thinking.
-   The more books you read, the quieter you become since it makes you listen more, think more and appreciate the world around you more, and thereby talk less.


# On Writing

-   Writing slows your thinking and improves your articulation skills.
-   Writing is an essential skill that everyone must learn. It is something that is useful throughout our lives.


# Advice

-   Anxiety is basically fear of the unknown. Figure out the unknown and you'll be way less anxious
